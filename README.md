# TaskLists (ReportEngine Work) 
## TaskList Files Syntax
The PlumHound Repo includes a sample TaskList that exports some basic BloodHoundAD Cypher queries to an HTML Report.  The included tasks\Default.tasks sample shows the basic syntax of the TaskList files.  The TaskList Files allow PlumHound to be fully scripted with batch jobs after the SharpHound dataset has been imported not BloodHoundAD on Neo4j.

### TaskList File Syntax

```plaintext
["Report Title","[Output-Format]","[Output-File]","[CypherQuery]"]
```
